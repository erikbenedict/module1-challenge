# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
As a developer it is my job to refactor existing code to meet a certain set of standards.
I am refactoring a marketing agency's website to make it more accessible to ensure that people with disabilities can access their website using assistive technologies. This will be beneficial to the business to better position them in search engines, as well as help avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website. This also continues my learning of leaving the code a little cleaner than when I found it, and improving the codebase for long-term sustainability.
