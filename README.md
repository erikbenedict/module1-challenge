# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
As a developer it is my job to refactor existing code to meet a certain set of standards.
I am refactoring a marketing agancy's website to make it more accessible to ensure that people with disabilities can access their website using assistive technologies. This will be benificial to the business to better position them in search engines, as well as help avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilites can't access their website. This also continues my learning of leaving the code a little cleaner than when I found it, and inproving the codebase for long-term sustainability.
